Problem Statement
Title: AI-Driven Risk Prediction Engine for Chronic Care Patients

Background:

Chronic conditions such as diabetes, obesity, and heart failure require continuous monitoring and proactive care. Despite access to vitals, lab results, and medication adherence data, predicting when a patient may deteriorate remains a major challenge. A reliable and explainable AI-driven solution could empower clinicians and care teams to intervene earlier, improve health outcomes, and reduce hospitalization risks.

Your Challenge:
Design and prototype an AI-driven Risk Prediction Engine that forecasts whether a chronic care patient is at risk of deterioration in the next 90 days. Your solution should leverage patient data (e.g., vitals, labs, medication adherence, lifestyle logs) and provide predictions in a way that is clinician-friendly, explainable, and actionable.

Key Requirements:

Prediction Model:

Input: 30â€“180 days of patient data

Output: Probability of deterioration within 90 days

Show evaluation metrics (AUROC, AUPRC, calibration, confusion matrix)

Explainability:

Identify global + local factors influencing predictions

Present explanations in simple, clinician-friendly terms

Dashboard / Prototype:

Cohort view: Display risk scores for all patients

Patient detail view: Show trends, key drivers, and recommended next actions
